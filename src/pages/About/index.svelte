<h2>Can you grow the largest network?</h2>
<p>
  SFBW Epicenter only lasts two days, but you can walk away with a valuable
  network of industry contacts that lives beyond a single conference. Meet
  attendees and sponsors, scan their badges, earn points and grow your
  reputation. We’ll even distribute random boosts to help you increase your haul
  of points.
</p>
<p>Build reputation points for every action you take</p>
<ul class="points-scheme">
  <li>
    <PointBox>+1</PointBox>
    Scan a badge
  </li>
  <li>
    <PointBox>+3</PointBox>
    Share contact details
  </li>
  <li>
    <PointBox>+2</PointBox>
    Scan a sponsors badge
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Reputation Rewards</h2>
<p>
  By earning reputation points, you’ll be eligible to receive prizes such as
  ledgers and rare collectibles. Once you’re logged in (See Getting Started
  below), visit “Rewards” in the app to see what you’re eligible for and how you
  can win more prizes.
</p>

<h2>Competition Rewards</h2>
<p>
  If you earn enough points, you’ll be eligible to receive a cash payout at the
  end of the conference.
</p>
<h3>Top 10</h3>

  equally split $2,000!
</p>
<h2>LinkedUp Game Mechanics FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why use LinkedUp?</h3>
<p>
  Networking at events is exhausting, business cards and contact data frequently
  get forgotten or lost, and most web2.0 contact apps lack comprehensive utility
  and use you and your contact's data to make money. We built LinkedUp to help
  you create a lasting network of valuable contacts that live on the blockchain
  and can always be accessed.
</p>
<p>
  Every time you take an action in LinkedUp (sharing your contact info, scanning
  someone’s badge) you’ll earn points that can be redeemed for rewards.
</p>
<h3>Why blockchain?</h3>
<p>
  You get to choose
  <b>WHO</b>
  can see your data and how much of it. You and your contact's details stay
  hidden while your reputation and notoriety grow.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Meet someone that you want to hang with after the conference? Share your
    telegram and mobile number.
  </li>
  <li>
    Want to follow up with that sales director but on your terms? Share just
    your work email.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Ok, so how does it work?</h3>
<p>Here’s the deal:</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Once you’ve checked-in to Blockchain Week, open the camera on your phone and
    scan the QR code on your conference badge.
  </li>
  <li>
    The game will open in your mobile web browser, and you’ll be asked to verify
    your profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    You’re good to go! Start scanning badges from other attendees and vendors,
    share your contact information, and earn points.
  </li>
  <li>Redeem your points for prizes. Nano Ledgers, t-shirts, and lots more.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How do I find the contact information for someone I’ve scanned?</h3>
<p>
  To see information for someone that you’ve shared information with, navigate
  to the Reputation page of LinkedUp and click on their photo.
</p>
<h3>What happens if I accidentally close the LinkedUp browser tab?</h3>
<p>
  Closing the browser tab won’t log you out of LinkedUp, so all you need to do
  is reopen the tab.
</p>
<p>
  Your session key is stored in a cookie, so if you clear your cookies you’ll
  need to take the following steps to open LinkedUp:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Open the camera on your phone and scan the QR code on your conference badge.
  </li>
  <li>
    A browser tab will open up asking you to click a verification link, which
    will send an email to the address you used to register for Blockchain Week.
  </li>
  <li>Follow the instructions in the email, and you’ll be set.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How do I earn points?</h3>
<p>
  You earn points every time you use LinkedUp to interact with someone at
  Blockchain Week:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>+1 for scanning a badge</li>
  <li>+3 for sharing contact details</li>
  <li>+2 for scanning a sponsor’s badge</li>
  <li>+6 for sharing contact details with a sponsor</li>
</ul>

<h3>What do I do with these points?</h3>
<p>
  Get rewards, of course! You can view and redeem available rewards by
  navigating to the Rewards tab in the drop-down menu.
</p>
<p>
  Rewards are nice, but how about something a bit bigger? Keep an eye on the
  LinkedUp leaderboard: if you’re one of the top participants at SF Blockchain
  Week you’ll be splitting one of several Competition Rewards with other
  attendees in your prize tier.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Top 10 of attendees will share a pool of $5,000!</li>
  <li>Top 11-30 attendees will share a pool of $2,000!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where do I pick up rewards that I’ve redeemed?</h3>
<p>
  All rewards may be picked up from the LinkedUp game booth. Be sure to show
  your redemption in the LinkedUp tab to confirm your item!
</p>
<h3>
  When SF BlockChain Week ends, can I still use my contacts from LinkedUp?
</h3>
<p>
  LinkedUp is hosted on the Cosmos blockchain, so you’ll always be able to
  access your contacts.
